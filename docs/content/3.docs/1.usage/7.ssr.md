# SSR utilities

Nuxt provides composables that allow you to interact directly with various aspects of the Nitro server.

## useReqHeaders

Within your pages, components and plugins you can use `useReqHeaders` to access the incoming request headers.

```js
const headers = useReqHeaders()
```

::alert{icon=ðŸ‘‰}
On client side, `useReqHeaders` will return an empty object.
::

## Example

The example below adds the request headers to an isomorphic `$fetch` call to ensure that the Nitro API endpoint has access to the headers.

```vue
<script setup>
const { data } = useFetch('/api/me', {
  headers: useReqHeaders()
})
</script>
```

## Options

- **`excludes`** Specifies headers not to include in the returned object.
- **`includes`**: Specifies headers to include in the returned object
